To use MLPython's interface to RT-Rank's decision tree implementation,
you'll need to compile a Python extension, which will require Boost.Python,
Boost.Thread and Boost.Jam.

To access RT-Rank through MLPython, do the following:

1. download RT-Rank 1.5 from here: https://sites.google.com/site/rtranking/download
2. copy the content of subdirectory cart/ into this package directory
3. create a Jamroot file by doing ``cp Jamroot.template Jamroot`` in the package directory
   and edit Jamroot by changing PUT_PATH_TO_BOOST_HERE by the path to your copy 
   of Boost (e.g. /home/USER/software/boost_1_46_0)
4. compile Python extension simply by running the command ``bjam release`` in package directory 
   (requires Boost.Python, Boost.Thread and Boost.Jam)
5  add path to the package directory to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable for
   linux, or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH for Mac OS X

And that should do it! Try 'import pyrtrank' to see if your installation is working.
