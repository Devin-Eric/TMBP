We have compiled and tested all functions in both Matlab and Octave environments.

1. Octave

We have tested the toolbox in Windows 7 (64bit) system and installed the Windows installer (Octave and Octave-Forge)
(\url{http://octave.sourceforge.net/}).

In the Octave environment:

1.1 The user run "make_octave" to compile all functions.
1.2 After compilation, the user run "quickstart" to check if all functions work properly.


2. Matlab

We have tested the toolbox in Windows 7 (64-bit) and Linux (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) (64-bit) in Matlab 2010b.
We choose the default compiler in Matlab.

In 64-bit Matlab environment:

1.1 The user run "make_matlab64" to compile all functions.
1.2 After compilation, the user run "quickstart" to check if all functions work properly.

In 32-bit Matlab environment:

1.1 The user run "make_matlab32" to compile all functions.
1.2 After compilation, the user run "quickstart" to check if all functions work properly.


3. Folders

../common: the common library file for all functions.
../datasets: the data set files in "*.mat" or "*.txt" format.
../source: all source "*.cpp" files in this toolbox.
../toolbox: all complied functions in this toolbox.
